# Cost Function Exploration

This notebook explores the concept of the cost function in the context of machine learning. It provides an implementation of the cost function, 
examines its behavior with a small dataset, and includes an interactive contour plot where you can manipulate parameters (`w` and `b`) to observe their effects.

## Overview

- **Cost_Function_Exploration.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook covers the implementation and exploration of the cost function. It includes interactive plots and detailed explanations about the impact of parameter changes on the cost function.

## Features

- Cost function implementation with a small dataset.
- Interactive contour plot for parameter manipulation (numpy and matplotlib).
- Detailed explanation of the cost function, including formula and insights.
- 3D visualization of the cost function for enhanced understanding.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cost-function-exploration.git
